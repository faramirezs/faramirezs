## Hi there, I' Alejo ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± As a software engineering student at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/de/), I am leveraging my 10+ years of experience in product strategy, data-driven web optimization and SEO to build a robust foundation in systems programming, full-stack development, and complex problem-solving. 

- ðŸ”­My transition from marketing to software engineering is fueled by a passion for building:
  - ai automations & agentic solutions, 
  - scalable systems and 
  - solving complex technical challenges, 

- âš¡ And enhanced by the rigorous, peer-driven curriculum of 42 Berlinâ€™s coding school. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, system administration, and cybersecurity, providing a robust foundation in software engineering.â€‹

- ðŸ‘¯ Open to internships and collaborative opportunities in the tech ecosystem.
