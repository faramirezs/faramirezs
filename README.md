### About Me

🎓 Software Engineering student from **42 Berlin** — 1,600+ hours of intensive systems programming in C/C++, building everything from HTTP servers to Docker infrastructure from scratch.
🔄 Transitioned from 10+ years of product strategy and web infrastructure into DevOps/MLOps, combining business insight with low-level systems knowledge.
🛠️ Currently working with **Python**, **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and cloud platforms (**AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**) to build scalable, automated solutions.
