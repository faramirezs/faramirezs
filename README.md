# Hi there, I'm Alejo 👋

**Ai Engineer** based in Berlin 🇩🇪

### About Me

🎓 Software Engineering student from **42 Berlin** — 1,600+ hours of intensive systems programming in C/C++, building everything from HTTP servers to Docker infrastructure from scratch.

🔄 Transitioned from 10+ years of product strategy and web infrastructure into DevOps/MLOps, combining business insight with low-level systems knowledge.

🛠️ Currently working with **Python**, **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and cloud platforms (**AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**) to build scalable, automated solutions.

🤖 Passionate about **AI automations & agentic workflows** — building multi-agent systems that solve real business problems.

### What I Build

- 🤖 **AI & Agentic solutions** — multi-agent workflows for automation
- 🐳 **Containerized infrastructure** — multi-service Docker architectures
- 🔁 **CI/CD pipelines** — GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing & deployment
- 🖥️ **Backend APIs** — FastAPI, RESTful services, payment integrations
